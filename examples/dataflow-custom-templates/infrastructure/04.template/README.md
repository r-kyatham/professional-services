# Overview

This module is responsible for provisioning the builder that 
builds the custom Dataflow template.  This module does not build the template
itself but provisions the process, using [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build)
that performs the build step.

This module achieves the following:

- Provision cloud build trigger
- Within cloud build trigger:
    1. Run the language specific build process i.e. gradle shadowJar, go build, etc.
    2. Execute the `gcloud dataflow flex-template` command with relevant arguments.

# Requirements

This module additionally requires the following steps before running the solution.
At this time there is not automated terraform solution for these steps.

## 1. Fork the repository into your own GitHub organization or personal account

See documentation and example on forking a repository on GitHub

https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo

## 2. Connect forked repository to Cloud Build

Navigate to Cloud Build to connect your GitHub forked repository.

https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers/connect

**IGNORE "Create a Trigger" STEP.  This module will build the trigger step**

See: https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/create-manage-triggers#connect_repo
for more details.
