# Deploy the Custom Dataflow template by following these steps

## Overview

The purpose of this walkthrough is to create
[Custom Dataflow templates](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/dataflow-templates).

The value of Custom Dataflow templates is that it allows us to execute
Dataflow jobs without installing any code.  This is useful to enable Dataflow
execution using an automated process or to enable others without technical
expertise to run jobs via a user-friendly guided user interface.

## 1. Select or create project

**It is recommended to go through this walkthrough using a new temporary Google
Cloud project, unrelated to any of your existing Google Cloud projects.**

Select or create a project to begin.

<walkthrough-project-setup></walkthrough-project-setup>

## 2. Set default project

```sh
gcloud config set project <walkthrough-project-id/>
```

## 3. Setup environment

Best practice recommends a Dataflow job to:
1) Utilize a worker service account to access the pipeline's files and resources
2) Minimally necessary IAM permissions for the worker service account
3) Minimally required Google cloud services

Therefore, this step will:

- Create service accounts
- Provision IAM credentials
- Enable required Google cloud services

Run the terraform workflow in
the [infrastructure/01.setup](infrastructure/01.setup) directory.

Terraform will ask your permission before provisioning resources.
If you agree with terraform provisioning resources,
type `yes` to proceed.

```sh
DIR=infrastructure/01.setup
terraform -chdir=$DIR init
terraform -chdir=$DIR apply -var='project=<walkthrough-project-id/>'
```

## 4. Provision network

Best practice recommends a Dataflow job to:
1) Utilize a custom network and subnetwork
2) Minimally necessary network firewall rules
3) Building Python custom templates additionally requires the use of a
[Cloud NAT](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview); per best practice we
execute the Dataflow job using private IPs

Therefore, this step will:

- Provision a custom network and subnetwork
- Provision firewall rules
- Provision a Cloud NAT and its dependent Cloud Router

Run the terraform workflow in
the [infrastructure/02.network](infrastructure/02.network) directory.

Terraform will ask your permission before provisioning resources.
If you agree with terraform provisioning resources,
type `yes` to proceed.

```sh
DIR=infrastructure/02.network
terraform -chdir=$DIR init
terraform -chdir=$DIR apply -var='project=<walkthrough-project-id/>'
```

## 5. Provision data pipeline IO resources

The Apache Beam example that our Dataflow template executes is a derived word
count for both [Java](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/examples/MinimalWordCount.java)
and [python](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/wordcount_minimal.py).

The word count example requires a source [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) bucket.
To make the example interesting, we copy all the files from
`gs://apache-beam-samples/shakespeare/*` to a custom bucket in our project.

Therefore, this step will:
- Provision a Google Cloud storage bucket
- Create Google Cloud storage objects to read from in the pipeline

Run the terraform workflow in
the [infrastructure/03.io](infrastructure/03.io) directory.

Terraform will ask your permission before provisioning resources.
If you agree with terraform provisioning resources,
type `yes` to proceed.

```sh
DIR=infrastructure/03.io
terraform -chdir=$DIR init
terraform -chdir=$DIR apply -var='project=<walkthrough-project-id/>'
```

## 6. Provision the Dataflow template builder

We will use [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build) to build the
custom Dataflow template.  There are advantages to using Cloud Build to build
our custom Dataflow template, instead of performing the necessary commands on
our local machine.  Cloud Build connects to our version control,
[GitHub](https://GitHub.com) in this example, so that any changes made to
a specific branch will automatically trigger a new build of our Dataflow
template.

Therefore, this step will:

- Provision cloud build trigger that will:
    1. Run the language specific build process i.e. gradle shadowJar, go build, etc.
    2. Execute the `gcloud dataflow flex-template` command with relevant arguments.

### 6.1. Fork the repository into your own GitHub organization or personal account

In order to benefit from [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build), the service
requires we own this repository; it will not work with a any repository, even
if it is public.

Therefore, complete these steps before proceeding:
1) [Fork the repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services/fork)
2) [Connect forked repository to Cloud Build](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers/connect)

### 6.2 Execute terraform module to provision Cloud Build trigger

First, set your GitHub organization or username:

```sh
GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=<change me>
```

Next, set expected defaults.  (_Note: Normally it makes sense to default terraform
variables instead of doing this._)

```sh
GITHUB_REPO_NAME=professional-services
WORKING_DIR_PREFIX=examples/dataflow-custom-templates
```

Run the terraform workflow in
the [infrastructure/04.template](infrastructure/04.template) directory.

Terraform will ask your permission before provisioning resources.
If you agree with terraform provisioning resources,
type `yes` to proceed.

```sh
DIR=infrastructure/04.template
terraform -chdir=$DIR init
terraform -chdir=$DIR apply -var="project=$(gcloud config get-value project)" -var="github_repository_owner=$GITHUB_REPO_OWNER" -var="github_repository_name=$GITHUB_REPO_NAME" -var="working_dir_prefix=$WORKING_DIR_PREFIX"
```

## 7. Run Cloud Build Trigger

Navigate to [cloud-build/triggers](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers).
You should see a Cloud Build trigger listed for each language of this example.
Click the `RUN` button next to the created Cloud Build trigger to execute the
custom template Cloud Build trigger for your language of choice manually.

See [Create Manual Triggers](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/create-manual-triggers?hl=en#running_manual_triggers)
for more information.

This step will take several minutes to complete.

## 8. Execute the Dataflow Template

### 1. Start the Dataflow Job creation form

There are multiple ways to run a Dataflow Job from a custom template.  We will
use the Google Cloud Web UI.

To start the process, navigate to [dataflow/createjob](https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow/createjob).

### 2. Select Custom Template

Select `Custom Template` from the `Dataflow template` drop down menu.  Then,
click the `BROWSE` button and navigate to the bucket with the name that starts
with `dataflow-templates-`.  Within this bucket, select the json file object
that represents the template details.  You should see a JSON file for each
of the Cloud Build triggers you ran to create the custom template.

### 3. Complete Dataflow Job template UI form

The Google Cloud console will further prompt for required fields such as Job
name and any required fields for the custom Dataflow template.

### 4. Run the template

When you are satisfied by the values provided to the custom Dataflow template,
click the `RUN` button.

### 5. Monitor the Dataflow Job

Navigate to [dataflow/jobs](https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow/jobs) to locate the job
you just created.  Clicking on the job will let you navigate to the job
monitoring screen.
